        A 2011 study conducted by the Digital Universe Corporation, showed that
        in 2011 alone, 1.8 zettabytes of data were produced by all businesses.
        That is the equivalent of 1.8 trillion gigabytes, the same as every U.S.
        citizen writing 3 tweets per minute for the next 26,976 years. The study
        also predicts that the overall amount of data produced annually, will
        grow by an extreme 5000% by the year 2020. However, what is the point of
        this mass collection of data if we arenâ€™t even able to make useful
        inferences from it? Thanks to customer data mining, that has all
        changed. To better understand this developing industry, we will explore
        what exactly customer data mining is and how it works, ending with the
        utilization of this technology by businesses. According to Queens
        University of Belfast, customer data mining is the practice of searching
        through mass amounts of customer data to find patterns that can better
        increase revenue and cut company costs. Customer data mining allows
        businesses to better organize and access data from customer interactions
        to find information on customer usage patterns.
